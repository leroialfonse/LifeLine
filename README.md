# ðŸ“¢ About

This is LifeLine, a rather personal project I built for myself, and anyone else who happens to live with chronic medical conditions.

When you have a health issue, you very quickly learn that there are huge demands on your mental real estate. Suddenly, there are a wealth of new terms, new people, events and locations to learn and commit to memory. This new information is vital, and being well apprised and clear on it is paramount to maintaining your best health.

But, when you have all of these new moving parts to keep in mind, on top of your already hectic life, things can fall through the cracks, and that is can spell trouble for your healthcare. That's why I built LifeLine. With LifeLine, you can more easily keep track of your doctors, appointments, medicines, and concerns. It's a way to organize and contain the deluge of new information that you are now responsible for, in a convienient and minimalist app that you can aceess anywhere.

# ðŸš€ Getting Started

## ðŸ’» Install

- Fork and clone the repository to your local computer.
- Complete and store an `.env` file in the `server/config` folder.
- `npm install` in the root folder, which installs the required dependencies.
- And, `npm run dev` in the root folder.
- This runs a local instance of mongodb. You can connect to it by connecting to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/` with any MongoDB client like [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).

# Optimizations

<p>This is a passion project, so I don't know if I'll ever be truly *finished* with it. That said, I do want to make improvements to the UI, and so I intend to redesign the app with React at some point. I would also like to add functionality that would enable users to communicate with their providers, whether that's through email or a chat application, but that's a little further out.</p>

<p>Additionally, because of the subject matter of the app concerning sensitive medical information, I need to explore how to give the app greater security, commensurate with HIPAA practices. These are just a few things that I forsee most pressingly right now.</p>
